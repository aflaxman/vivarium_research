=============================
The Vivarium Modeling Process
=============================

The simulation science team is actively working on building out and improving a
model development process to guide the interactions between researchers and
software engineers.

Our general process for creating this documentation is the following:

1. Kickoff presentation on the topic to be documented (for example James will talk for about an hour about details in modeling causes of disease)
2. Identify what information is needed to model causes
3. Assign topics to team members, for which each goal is to produce a 10-20 minutes presentation on the topic
4. Reconvene for 1-2 hours to give presentation on each topic and have discussions about them
5. Produce documentation in .rst format, and a pull request to this git repo, containing a written version of the 10-20 minute presentation and the questions and answers from the ensuing discussion

Additional model development process is migrating here from the
Hub. Until then, you can still find the process documentation there!
